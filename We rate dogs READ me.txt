The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. 
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. 
The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." 
WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. 
This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.
The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything. 
One column the archive does contain though: each tweet's text, which I used to extract rating, dog name, and dog "stage" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) 
to make this Twitter archive "enhanced." Of the 5000+ tweets, I have filtered for tweets with ratings only (there are 2356).

i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. 
This file (image_predictions.tsv) is hosted on Udacity's servers and should be downloaded programmatically using the 
Requests library and the following URL:

## Context
The goal: wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. 
Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations.

## Summary of Findings
All sorts of wonderful doggy related visuals and info.
